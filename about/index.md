### ACHIEVEMENTS
## CAPSTONE PROJECT
# Ferguson Enterprise | Multi-Channel Attribution Model, Attention RNN
* Processed 550,000 customer data about their interactions with the website and built model to predict customer
conversion (purchase) rate and attribute values to each step along customer digital journey.
* Achieved 96% accuracy and 0.99 AUC score on predicting customer conversion by creating a state-of-the art Multi-
Channel Attribution Model; and assigned credits to different customer channels using the trained model.
* The model merged Attention + LSTM (deal with sequential channel data) and Embedding FNN (process consumer
behavioral and demographic data). The revised softmax function took time decay effects into consideration.
* The model can be easily transferred into Wide & Deep product recommendation system.
