## INTRODUCATION

I love Rubik's Cube, I could solve 3\*3 (within 30 seconds), 4\*4, 5\*5, 6\*6. Every week I spend at least 6 hours on it.
I am in the Third Wave of Coffee, so I love Manual Brew: Pour-over, Chemex, Siphone Brewing, etc. I even got a Certificate for that.
I love traveling, taking in different culture
...
But, **I love data the most**.

I am holding Master degrees both in Marketing and Business Analytics <br>
So I position myself as a Data Scientist with strong Business Acumen <br>
I am adept at extracting business wants from stakeholders and <br>
Transforming data into user stories with the state-of-the-art modeling techiques and enriched visualizations<br>
It motivates me a lot to be able to influence the Society with data<br>
