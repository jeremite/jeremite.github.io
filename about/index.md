## INTRODUCATION

I love Rubik's Cube, I could solve 3\*3 (within 30 seconds), 4\*4, 5\*5, 6\*6. <br>
Every week I spend at least 4-6 hours on it. <br>
I am in the Third Wave of Coffee Movement, so I love Manual Brewing: <br>
"Pour-over, Chemex, Siphone Brewing, etc". I even got a Certificate for that. <br>
I love traveling, taking in different culture <br>
...... <br>

But, **I love data the most**.

I am holding Master degrees both in Marketing and Business Analytics <br>
As a result, I position myself as a Data Scientist with strong Business Acumen <br>
I am adept at extracting business wants from stakeholders and <br>
Transforming data into user stories with proper visualizations <br>
I never stop learning, always trying to keep up with the state-of-the-art modeling techiques <br>

What motivates me a lot? To be able to influence the Society with data<br>
